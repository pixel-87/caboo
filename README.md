# Game Idea

Real-time, terminal/tui caboo game. 

Could be p2p, but for now will just be a simple websocket server (could ssh in instead?).

using python so easy for people to contribute (would love to do golang tho)

TUI lib, so its pretty (`Textual` for python).

FastAPI or Flask for the webserver.

Not sure on networking side. 

do actual ASCII card art.

optional log with a flag.

How to start a game? 
Maybe just run the script, and see open games e.g. starting in 3 mins.

# TODO

- [ ] Implement Card class
- [ ] Implement specific card powers
